# Polygon Advance module 1 Project

MyNftCollection.sol Contract

Licence: MIT

Solidity: ^0.8.1

Generate a 5-item collection using DALL-E 2 or Midjourney:
Both DALL-E 2 and Midjourney are AI models for image generation. To create a collection of images using either of these models, you'll need to have access to the appropriate environment and APIs provided by the creators of these models.

Store items on IPFS using pinata.cloud:
To store items on IPFS, you can use the Pinata cloud service. You'll need to sign up for an account on Pinata and follow their documentation to learn how to upload and pin your images or files to the IPFS network.

Deploy an ERC721 or ERC1155 contract to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet:
To deploy an ERC721 or ERC1155 contract to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet, you can use a development framework like Hardhat or Truffle. You'll need some Goerli test ether (ETH) to deploy the contract.
To compile solidity file use npx hardhat compile
To deploy contract: npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli

Write a Hardhat script to batch mint all NFTs (using ERC721A):
You can use Hardhat (or another development framework) to write a script that mints multiple NFTs in a batch. For the ERC721A standard, consider using the OpenZeppelin ERC721Mintable extension for batch minting.
To mint nfts : npx hardhat run scripts/batchMint.js --network goerli

Write a Hardhat script to batch transfer NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai using the FxPortal Bridge:
To transfer NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai, you'll need to use the FxPortal Bridge, which is provided by Polygon (Matic). You'll need to set up the bridge and initiate the transfer using the correct functions and configurations.
To approve and deposit : npx hardhat run scripts/approveDeposit.js --network mumbai
